# Portfolio-Website
My portfolio website!

### Version 1
This version of the website only holds the projects tab and the home tab.
1) Home: Serves as an index page that gives a brief "about me" section. 
2) Projects: Shows off the basics of my projects that are present on my resume. Each of these projects has a hero card, a project description that is accompanied by a video demonstration, a design concepts section containing a carousel of different concepts, a refleciton section to show what I learned about from this project and finally a button that leads to the next project.

### Future updates:
1) Algorithms Section: This will talk about some of my favorite algorithms that I learned from CS 4150, these are intended to be full explinations by me with a video demo of their use.
2) Favorite Topics: These will be some of my favorite topics from each one of my classes. Very similar to the algorithms section but with various different focues
3) Comments section. This will allow the viewer of a project to leave some feedback that will be sent directly to my email.

All of these will be coming by the end of the year depending on time. Winter 2026 target date.
I will also continue to add new projects as more become completed with my coursework. This can be easily done with just a few credentials added in under admin per project.
